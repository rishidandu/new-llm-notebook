# 🧠 Enhanced RAG System Features

## Overview

The ASU RAG system has been enhanced with intelligent query handling capabilities that make it much more interactive and useful. Instead of just providing basic answers, the system now:

- **Asks clarifying questions** when queries are vague
- **Suggests follow-up questions** for deeper exploration
- **Provides actionable next steps** 
- **Recommends related topics** for further learning
- **Shows confidence scores** for answer quality
- **Offers context-aware responses** based on query type

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. 🤔 Intelligent Clarification Questions

When you ask a vague question, the system automatically detects this and asks for clarification:

**Example Query:** "I want a good job"
**System Response:**
- Asks: "Are you looking for on-campus or off-campus job opportunities?"
- Provides options: "On-campus", "Off-campus", "Both", "Not sure"
- Explains why: "This will help me provide more relevant job listings and advice"

### 2. 💭 Follow-up Question Suggestions

The system suggests relevant questions you might want to ask next:

**Example:** For job queries, it suggests:
- "What's your major? This could help me suggest more relevant opportunities."
- "Are you looking for on-campus or off-campus positions?"
- "What's your preferred work schedule (weekdays, weekends, evenings)?"

### 3. ✅ Actionable Next Steps

Instead of just providing information, the system gives you specific things to do:

**For Job Queries:**
- Check the Student Jobs board on My ASU daily
- Contact your department's administrative office
- Visit the Career Services office
- Update your resume and cover letter

**For Course Queries:**
- Check course registration dates

### 5. 📊 Confidence Scoring

Each response includes a confidence score showing how reliable the answer is:
- 🟢 **High Confidence (80%+)**: Very reliable information
- 🟡 **Medium Confidence (60-80%)**: Generally reliable
- 🔴 **Low Confidence (<60%)**: May need more specific information

### 6. 🎯 Context-Aware Responses

The system analyzes your query type and provides appropriate enhancements:

| Query Type | Clarification Questions | Follow-ups | Action Items | Related Topics |
|------------|------------------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Jobs** | Major, Location preference | Schedule, Skills | Job boards, Career services | Employment resources |
